    <h4 style='text-decoration:underline;'>Why install Linux?</h4>
    <p>
        Well, there is many factors to why you should install a Linux based operation
        system on your computer.<br>
        1. Your old operation system is outdated (Windows XP is not supported anymore).<br>
        2. Your computer is old and installing one of the newest Windows operation systems
        would be costly and not worth it, and might not even run very good (could 
        buy a new computer instead).<br>
        3. You have many computers that need OS upgrades (Windows could be costly).<br>
        4. You just need a computer that has the basic of programs installed 
        (Web-browser, Office programs, music/video playback).
