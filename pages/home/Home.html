        Why did i make this site? Well, after trying to dig into the Linux 
        community and struggling to find out what kind of 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system" target='_blank'>
        OS Distribution</a> I should choose, how to install it, and generally how 
        to manage going away from the well known Microsoft operation system 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows" target="_blank">Windows</a>
        and into the Linux world.
    </p>
    <p>I searched the web over and over again after useful things I would need to 
        know to make it easier and found loads of different pages. This made it hard 
        to keep track on everything and what pages had what. Therefore I decided to 
        make this page, and put everything I had learned from different pages 
        around the Internet on the same page. Some things I found out for myself 
        others I had to really, really search for.
    </p>
    <p>
        So I really hope this page will help others to find out the things they 
        need and hopefully I can keep this page as up to date as possible in this 
        fast changing environment.
